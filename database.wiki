=== BLARNEY ===
""Short Description"" : BLARNEY is a communications surveillance program, started in 1978 and operated under FISA. The collection takes place at top-level telecommunications facilities within the United States, choke points through which most traffic will flow, including wireless. This type of surveillance is referred to as "[[UPSTREAM]] collection". Among the facilities associated with BLARNEY are AT&T's Room 641A in San Francisco, California, revealed in 2006 by Mark Klein, and another in New Jersey. Like its counterparts, BLARNEY was expanded after the September 11 attacks. Information collected from BLARNEY is shared with many agencies in the United States, including the CIA, NSA, FBI and DOJ, it is also shared with the Five Eyes and NATO. A number of private companies also have access.Key Targets are : Diplomatic establishment, counterterrorism, Foreign Government, Economic

=== BOUNDLESSINFORMANT ===
""Short Description"" : BOUNDLESSINFORMANT is a big data analysis and data visualization system used by the NSA to give managers summaries of the NSA's world wide data collection activities. According to a Top Secret heat map display also published by The Guardian and produced by the Boundless Informant program, almost 3 billion data elements from inside the United States were captured by the NSA over a 30-day period ending in March 2013.Data analyzed by BOUNDLESSINFORMANT includes electronic surveillance program records ([[dni]]) and telephone call metadata records ([[dnr]]) stored in an NSA data archive called [[GM-PLACE]]. It does not include FISA data, according to the FAQ memo. [[PRISM]] ([[US-984XN]]), which was revealed at the same time as BOUNDLESSINFORMANT, is one source of DNR data. According to the map, BOUNDLESSINFORMANT summarizes data records from 504 separate [[dnr]] and [[dnr]] collection sources (SIGADs). In the map, countries that are under surveillance are assigned a color from green, representing least coverage to red, most intensive.

=== BULLRUN ===
""Short Description"" : BULLRUN - the successor to the program called [[MANASSAS]], both named after American Civil War battles - is a clandestine, highly classified decryption program run by the NSA. The British signals intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has a similar program codenamed [[EDGEHILL]]. Access to the program is limited to a group of top personnel at the Five Eyes (FVEY), NSA and the signals intelligence agencies of Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Signals that cannot be decrypted with current technology may be retained indefinitely while the agencies continue to attempt to decrypt them: "Documents show that the N.S.A. has been waging a war against encryption using a battery of methods that include working with industry to weaken encryption standards, making design changes to cryptographic software, and pushing international encryption standards it knows it can break." (The New York Times)

=== CW ===
""Short Description"" : Continuous Wave aka [[CW]] is a continuous radio signal (like [[CTX4000]] or [[PHOTOANGLO]]) sent toward a target so that the reflected radio wave is modulated by the signal to intercept. It's the default interception mechanism of NSA for both voice, PS2 and USB keyboard keypresses, exfiltered data, network traffic and any kind of data the NSA is interested to extract from a target. It's a very advanced attack where a Radar sends a [[CW]] toward a target covertly equipped with a eavesdropping bug called a [[RETROREFLECTOR]] which will modulate the original [[CW]] signal and re-radiate this modulated [[CW]] so that it can be picked up by the emitting Radar. The benefit of such technique is that there is no need for the eavesdropping bug to generate radio signal, and therefore, no need for huge batteries or power. It also means that the bug can be turned on and off remotely, providing easy way to turn off the bug when a bug sweep detection team is trying to located it. The downside is that it's dangerous for health as the Radar signal between 1Ghz and 6Ghz can be harmful to human and cause illness and cancer, as it did numerous times in the past since the first time it was detected in the US Embassy in Moscow, Russia.

=== DEITYBOUNCE ===
""Short Description"" : DEITYBOUNCE provides software application persistence on Dell PowerEdge servers by exploiting the motherboard BIOS and utilizing System Management Mode (SMM) to gain periodic execution while the Operating System loads. This technique supports multi-processor systems with RAID hardware and Microsoft Windows 2000, 2003, and XP. It currently targets Dell PowerEdge 1850/2850/1950/2950 RAID servers, using BIOS versions A02, A05, A06, 1.1.0, 1.2.0, or 1.3.7. Through remote access or [[INTERDICTION]], [[ARKSTREAM]] is used to reflash the BIOS on a target machine to implant DEITYBOUNCE and its payload (the implant installer).Can be installed by non-technical user with USB thumb drive. Once implanted, DEITYBOUNCE's frequency of execution (dropping the payload) is configurable and will occur when the target machine powers on.

=== DISHFIRE ===
""Short Description"" : DISHFIRE is an SMS repository, storing over 194 million text messages a day, according to the NSA. The database includes names, geocoordinates, missed calls, SIM card changes, roaming info, travel info, and financial info. The Dishfire collection is indiscriminate, collecting "pretty much everything it can," according to an NSA presentation. An NSA program called Prefer then extracts "useful information" through message recomination and metadata extraction from stored content. GCHQ was also given full access to DISHFIRE, including UK citizens' data which GCHQ is not legally allowed to collect on its own.

=== FEEDTROUGH ===
""Short Description"" : FEEDTROUGH is a persistence technique for two software implants, DNT's [[BANANAGLEE]] and CES's [[ZESTYLEAK]] used against Juniper Netscreen firewalls. FEEDTROUGH can be used to persist two implants, [[ZESTYLEAK]] and/or [[BANANAGLEE]] across reboots and software upgrades on known and covered OS's for the following Netscreen firewalls, ns5xt, ns25, ns50, ns200, ns500 and ISG 1000. There is no direct communication to or from FEEDTROUGH, but if present, the [[BANANAGLEE]] implant can receive and transmit covert channel comms, and for certain platforms, [[BANANAGLEE]] can also update FEEDTROUGH. FEEDTROUGH however can only persist OS's included in its databases. Therefore this is best employed with known OS's and if a new OS comes out, then the customer would need to add this OS to the FEEDTROUGH database for that particular firewall.

=== IRATEMONK ===
""Short Description"" : provides software application persistence on desktop and laptop computers by implanting the hard drive firmware to gain execution throught Master Boot Record (MBR) substitution. This technique supports systems without RAID hardware that boot from a variety of Western Digital, Seagate, Maxtor and Samsung hard drives on FAT, NTFS, EXT3 and UFS file systems. Through remote access or [[INTERDICTION]], [[UNITEDRAKE]], or [[STRAITBAZZARE]] are used in conjunction with [[SLICKERVICAR]] to upload the hard drive firmware onto the target machine to implant IRATEMONK and its payload (the implant installer). Once implanted, IRATEMONK's frequency of execution (dropping the payload) is configurable and will occur when the target machine powers on.

=== IRONCHEF ===
""Short Description"" : IRONCHEF provides access persistence to target systems by exploiting the motherboard BIOS and utilizing System Management Mode (SMM) to communicate with a hardware implant that provides two-way RF communication.This technique supports the HP Proliant 380DL G5 server, onto which a hardware implant has been installed that communicates over the I2C Interface ([[WAGONBED]]). Through [[INTERDICTION]], IRONCHEF, a software CNE implant and the hardware implant are installed onto the system. If the software CNE implant is removed from the target machine, IRONCHEF is used to access the machine, determine the reason for removal of the software, and then reinstall the software from a listening post to the target system.

=== LOUDAUTO ===
""Short Description"" : Audio-based RF retro-reflector. Provides room audio from targeted space using radar and basic post-processing. LOUDAUTO's current design maximizes the gain of the microphone. This makes it extremely useful for picking up room audio. It can pick up speech at a standard, office volume from over 20' away. (NOTE: Concealments may reduce this distance.) It uses very little power (~15 uA at 3.0 VDC), so little, in fact, that battery self-discharge is more of an issue for serviceable lifetime than the power draw from this unit. The simplicity of the design allows the form factor to be tailored for specific operation requirements. All components at COTS and so are non-attributable to NSA.

=== MAINWAY ===
""Short Description"" : MAINWAY is a database maintained by the NSA containing metadata for hundreds of billions of telephone calls made through the four largest telephone carriers in the United States: AT&T and Verizon. It is estimated that the database contains over 1.9 trillion call-detail records. The records include detailed call information (caller, receiver, date/time of call, length of call, etc.) for use in traffic analysis and social network analysis, but do not include audio information or transcripts of the content of the phone calls. Similar programs exist or are planned in other countries, including Sweden (Titan traffic database) and Great Britain (Interception Modernisation Programme)

=== MJOLNIR ===
""Short Description"" : A custom Tor client library meant to be indistinguishable from the original Tor client, but which allows an unlimited number of servers within the Tor circuit. This was to allow for DoS attacks on the Tor network. It was also hypothesized that MJOLNIR would be able to be used for MITM attacks by forging certificates. The library was created and tested by persons during a 2006 CES summer program who set up an internal Tor network to analyze traffic. Mjolnir was the “Hammer of Thor”.

=== MUSCULAR ===
""Short Description"" : MUSCULAR (DS-200B), located in the United Kingdom, is the name of a surveillance programme jointly operated by GCHQ and the NSA. GCHQ (primary operator of the program) and the NSA have secretly broken into the main communications links that connect Yahoo and Google data centers around the world. Substantive information about the program was made public at the end of October, 2013. MUSCULAR is one of at least four other similar programs that rely on a trusted 2nd party, programs which together are known as [[WINDSTOP]]. In a 30-day period from December 2012 to January 2013, MUSCULAR was responsible for collecting 181 million records. It was however dwarfed by another [[WINDSTOP]] program known (insofar) only by its code [[DS-300]] and codename [[INCENSER]], which collected over 14 billion records in the same period.

=== NIGHTSTAND ===
""Short Description"" : An active 802.11 wireless exploitation and injection tool for payload /exploit delivery into otherwise denied target space. NIGHTSTAND is typically used in operations where wired access to the target is not possible. Standalone tool currently running on an x86 laptop loaded with Linux Fedora Core 3. Exploitable targets include Win2k, WinXP, WinXPSP1, WinXPSP2 running internet explorer versions 5.0-6.0. NIGHTSTAND packet injection can target one client or multiple targets on a wireless network. Attack is undetectable by the user. Use of external amplifiers and antennas in both experimental operational scenarios have resulted in successful NIGHTSTAND attacks from as far away as eight miles under ideal environmental conditions. Presumably, the NSA can use this "injection tool" in all the same ways it uses [[QUANTUM]]. For example, it can redirect users to [[FOXACID]] servers in order to attack their computers.

=== PRISM ===
""Short Description"" : PRISM is not about bulk or mass surveillance, but for collecting communications of specifically identified targets. NSA also has no "direct access" to the servers of companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google - it's a unit of the FBI that actually picks up the data. In total, ca. 227 million internet communications are collected under the PRISM program each year, contributing to reports about terrorism and a wide variety of other national security issues. Anually, NSA analysts write more than 20.000 PRISM-based reports, which is ca. 15% of all intelligence reports the agency produces.

=== QFIRE ===
""Short Description"" : System used for infecting computers. Involves both [[TURMOIL]], [[TURBINE]], and additional infrastructure. Co-opted routers, according to Jacob Appelbaum, these may in cases be unwitting home or business routers, that have been “pwned”. The Goal seems to be to reduce latency, and therefor increase the success rate of [[QUANTUMINSERT]]/[[FOXACID]] attacks. Eliminate trans-Atlantic/Pacific latency. Consolidated low-latency [[QUANTUMTHEORY]], capability under development for forward-based defense.

=== QUANTUM ===
""Short Description"" : To trick targets into visiting a [[FOXACID]] server, the NSA relies on its secret partnerships with US telecoms companies. As part of the [[TURMOIL]] system, the NSA places secret servers, codenamed [[QUANTUM]], at key places on the Internet backbone for a man-in-the-middle (or a man-in-the-side). The NSA uses these fast [[QUANTUM]] servers to execute a packet injection attack, which surreptitiously redirects the target to the [[FOXACID]] server.

=== RAGEMASTER ===
""Short Description"" : provides a target for RF flooding and allows for easier collection of the [[VAGRANT]] video signal. The current RAGEMASTER unit taps the red video line on the VGA cable. It was found that, empirically, this provides the best video return and cleanest readout of the monitor contents. When the RAGEMASTER is illuminated by a radar unit, the illuminating signal is modulated with the red video information. This information is re-radiated, where it is picked up at the radar, demodulated, and passed onto the processing unit, such as a [[LFS-2]] and an external monitor.

=== SCHOOLMONTANA ===
""Short Description"" : SCHOOLMONTANA provides persistence for DNT implants. The DNT implant will survive an upgrade or replacement of the operating system -- including physically replacing the router's compact flash card. Currently, the intended DNT Implant to persist is VALIDATOR, which must be run as a user process on the target operating system. The vector of attack is the modification of the target's BIOS. The modification will add the necessary software to the BIOS and modify its software to execute the SCHOOLMONTANA implant at the end of its native System Management Mode (SMM) handler. SCHOOLMONTANA must support all modern versions of JUNOS, which is a version of FreeBSD customized by Juniper. Upon system boot, the JUNOS operating system is modified in memory to run the implant, and provide persistent kernel modifications to support implant execution.

=== SIERRAMONTANA ===
""Short Description"" : SIERRAMONTANA provides persistence for DNT implants. The DNT implant will survive an upgrade or replacement of the operating system -- including physically replacing the router's compact flash card. Currently, the intended DNT Implant to persist is VALIDATOR, which must be run as a user process on the target operating system. The vector of attack is the modification of the target's BIOS. The modification will add the necessary software to the BIOS and modify its software to execute the SIERRAMONTANA implant at the end of its native System Management Mode (SMM) handler. SIERRAMONTANA must support all modern versions of JUNOS, which is a version of FreeBSD customized by Juniper. Upon system boot, the JUNOS operating system is modified in memory to run the implant, and provide persistent kernel modifications to support implant execution. SIERRAMONTANA is the cover term for the persistence technique to deploy a DNT implant to Juniper M-Series routers

=== SOUFFLETROUGH ===
""Short Description"" : SOUFFLETROUGH is a BIOS persistence implant for Juniper SSG 500 and SSG 300 firewalls. It persists DNT's [[BANANAGLEE]] software implant. [[BANANAGLEE]] also has an advanced persistent back-door capability. SOUFFLETROUGH is a BIOS persistence implant for Juniper SSG 500 and SSG 300 series firewalls (320M, 350M, 520, 550, 520M, 550M). It persists DNT's [[BANANAGLEE]] software implant and modifies the Juniper firewall's operating system (ScreenOS) at boot time. If [[BANANAGLEE]] support is not available for the booting operating system, it can install a Persistent Backdoor (PBD) designed to work with [[BANANAGLEE]]'s communications structure, so that full access can be reacquired at a later time. It takes advantage of Intel's System Management Mode for enhanced reliability and covertness. The PDB is also able to beacon home, and is fully configurable. A typical SOUFFLETROUGH deployment on a target firewall with an exfiltration path to the Remote Operations Center (ROC) is shown above. SOUFFLETROUGH is remotely upgradeable and is also remotely installable provided [[BANANAGLEE]] is already on the firewall of interest.

=== STELLARWIND ===
""Short Description"" : [[STELLARWIND]] is the code name of a Sensitive Compartmented Information security compartment for information collected under the President's Surveillance Program (PSP). This was a program by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) during the presidency of George W. Bush and revealed by Thomas Tamm to the The New York Times in 2008. The operation was approved by President George W. Bush shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001. STELLARWIND was succeeded during the presidency of Barack Obama by four major lines of intelligence collection in the territorial United States together capable of spanning the full range of modern telecommunications. The program's activities involved data mining of a large database of the communications of American citizens, including email communications, phone conversations, financial transactions, and Internet activity.

=== STORMBREW ===
""Short Description"" : [[STORMBREW]] is an umbrella program involving surveillance of telecommunications. It falls under the category of "[[UPSTREAM]] collection," meaning that data is pulled directly from fiber-optic cables and top-level communications infrastructure. There is also a SIGAD of the same name, which is described as a "key corporate partner." A map shows that the collection is done entirely within the United States. This corporate partner has servers in Washington, California, Texas, Florida, and in or around New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. [[UPSTREAM]] collection programs allow access to very high volumes of data, and most of the pre-selection is done by the providers themselves, before the data is passed on to the NSA.

=== STUCCOMONTANA ===
""Short Description"" : provides persistence for [[DNT]] implants. The [[DNT]] implant will survive an upgrade or replacement of the operating system - including physically replacing the router's compact flash card. Currently, the intended DNT Implant to persist is [[VALIDATOR]], which must be run as a user process on the target operating system. The vector of attack is the modification of the target's BIOS. The modification will add the necessary software to the BIOS and modify its software to execute the [[SIERRAMONTANA]] implant at the end of its native System Management Mode (SMM) handler. [[STUCCOMONTANA]] must support all modern versions of JUNOS, which is a version of FreeBSD customized by Juniper. Upon system boot, the [[JUNOS]] operating system is modified in memory to run the implant, and provide persistent kernel modifications to support implant execution. [[STUCCOMONTANA]] is the cover term for the persistence technique to deploy a DNT implant to Juniper T-Series routers.

=== STUXNET ===
""Short Description"" : A jointly US/Isreali written piece of malware intended to infect, and physically destroy five Iranian organizations, with the probable target widely suspected to be uranium enrichment infrastructure in Iran . (which it did) Also spilled on to non-targeted SCADA systems, causing “collateral damage”. Using 0-day exploits, it infected Personal Computers near the targeted Installation: then it waited several months to infect a USB-key which will be connected on the internal-network of the target. After that, a payload dedicated to Siemens Systems is enabled

=== SWAP ===
""Short Description"" : SWAP provides software application persistence by exploiting the motherboard BIOS and the hard drive's Host Protected Area to gain periodic execution before the Operating System loads. This technique supports single or multi-processor systems running Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, or Solaris with the following file systems: FAT32, NTFS, EXT2, EXT3, or UFS1.0. Through remote access or [[INTERDICTION]], [[ARKSTREAM]] is used to reflash the BIOS and [[TWISTEDKILT]] to write the Host Protected Area on the hard drive on a target machine in order to implant SWAP and its payload (the implant installer). Once implanted, SWAP's frequency of execution (dropping the playload) is configurable and will occur when the target machine powers on.

=== TAO ===
""Short Description"" : The NSA's TAO (Tailored Access Operations) hacking unit is considered to be the intelligence agency's top secret weapon. It maintains its own covert network, infiltrates computers around the world and even intercepts shipping deliveries to plant back doors in electronics ordered by those it is targeting. [...] During the middle part of the last decade, the special unit succeeded in gaining access to 258 targets in 89 countries -- nearly everywhere in the world. In 2010, it conducted 279 operations worldwide.

=== TAWDRYYARD ===
""Short Description"" : Beacon RF retro-reflector. Provides return when illuminated with radar to provide rough positional location. TAWDRYYARD is used as a beacon, typically to assist in locating and identifying deployed [[RAGEMASTER]] units. Current design allows it to be detected and located quite easily within a 50' radius of the radar system being used to illuminate it. TAWDRYYARD draws as 8 mu;A at 2.5V (20mu;W) allowing a standard lithium coin cell to power it for months or years. The simplicity of the design allows the form factor to be tailored for specific operational requirements. Future capabilities being considered are return of GPS coordinates and a unique target identifier and automatic processing to scan a target area for presence of TAWDRYYARDs. All components are COTS and so are non-attributable to NSA.

=== THINTREAD ===
""Short Description"" : THINTREAD is the name of a project that the NSA pursued during the 1990s. The program involved wiretapping and sophisticated analysis of the resulting data, but according to the article, the program was discontinued three weeks before the September 11, 2001 attacks due to the changes in priorities and the consolidation of U.S. intelligence authority. The "change in priority" consisted of the decision made by the director of NSA General Michael V. Hayden to go with a concept called [[TRAILBLAZER]], despite the fact that THINTREAD was a working prototype that protected the privacy of U.S. citizens.

=== TURBULENCE ===
""Short Description"" : TURBULENCE is a project started circa 2005. It was developed in small, inexpensive "test" pieces rather than one grand plan like its failed predecessor, the [[TRAILBLAZER]]. It also includes offensive cyber-warfare capabilities, like injecting malware into remote computers. The United States Congress criticized the project in 2007 for having similar bureaucratic problems as the [[TRAILBLAZER]] Project. TURBULENCE includes nine core programs, with intriguing names such as [[TURMOIL]], [[TUTELAGE]] and [[TRAFFICTHIEF]]

=== UAV ===
""Short Description"" : Unmanned aerial vehicle. A drone. The NSA is using complex analysis of electronic surveillance, rather than human intelligence, as the primary method to locate targets for lethal drone strikes – an unreliable tactic that results in the deaths of innocent or unidentified people. In one tactic, the NSA “geolocates” the SIM card or handset of a suspected terrorist’s mobile phone, enabling the CIA and U.S. military to conduct night raids and drone strikes to kill or capture the individual in possession of the device.

""Short Description"" : A program similar to [[STRAITBIZARRE]], used for uploading malicious HDD firmware, works with [[SLICKERVICAR]]. Known components include a GUI, a database, and a server, and a manned listening post. It includes a trojan of the same name. Digital Network Technologies (DNT), a private company, actively maintains the listening posts for [[UNITEDRAKE]], as well as design and deploy malware.

=== UPSTREAM ===
""Short Description"" : The UPSTREAM program is a telecommunication interception facility operated by [[AT&T]] for the NSA that commenced operations in 2003 and was exposed in 2006. Room 641A is located in the SBC Communications building at 611 Folsom Street, San Francisco, three floors of which were occupied by AT&T before SBC purchased AT&T. The room was referred to in internal AT&T documents as the SG3 [Study Group 3] Secure Room. It is fed by fiber optic lines from beam splitters installed in fiber optic trunks carrying Internet backbone traffic and, as analyzed by J. Scott Marcus, a former CTO for GTE and a former adviser to the FCC, has access to all Internet traffic that passes through the building, and therefore "the capability to enable surveillance and analysis of internet content on a massive scale, including both overseas and purely domestic traffic." Former director of the NSA's World Geopolitical and Military Analysis Reporting Group, William Binney, has estimated that 10 to 20 such facilities have been installed throughout the United States. [[TEMPORA]] is the [[GCHQ]]'s UPSTREAM.

=== VAGRANT ===
""Short Description"" : collection of computer Screens. The monitor cables are rigged with an RF retro reflector, ([[RAGEMASTER]]). [[VAGRANT]] collection therefor requires a continuous RF generator such as [[CTX4000]] or [[PHOTOANGLO]], and a system to process and display the returned video signal such as [[NIGHTWATCH]], [[GOTHAM]], [[LS-2]] (with an external monitor), or [[VIEWPLATE]]. Known to be deployed in the field , as of September 2010 at the following embassies: Brazil's UN Mission in NY ([[POKOMOKE]]), France's UN Mission in NY ([[BLACKFOOT]]), India's Embassy and annex in DC, and India's UN Mission in New York. India's embassies were slated to be detasked, at the time of the document. Context of documents seems to suggest, but does not definitively prove that the coverterm VAGRANT only applies to the signal itself.

=== VALIDATOR ===
""Short Description"" : A software based malware item designed to run on certain Juniper routers (J, M, and T Series) running the JUNOS operating system. It must be maintained by means of a malicious BIOS modification. A typical use case involves the exfiltration of data from the victimized system. A separate document describes VALIDATOR as a backdoor used against Windows systems (win 98-2003). In this instance, it will identify the system, and if it is truly a target, invite a more sophisticated trojan in, such as [[UNITEDRAKE]] or [[OLYMPUS]]. This trojan has been used to de-anonymize tor users. A third version of VALIDATOR works for Apple iOS devices. The [[QUANTUMNATION]] states that the success rate against iOS devices is 100%.
